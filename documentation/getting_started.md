## 1. Choose a Topic
Before you begin building anything, you'll need to know what instant answer it is that you want to provide. If you don't have any ideas, feel free to borrow one from our [ideas forum](http://ideas.duckduckhack.com/).

## 2. Determine Data Source
Now that you know what question you're answering, you'll need to find a source for your data. It could be anything such as functions you write, a large dataset or even an API.

Using this flowchart should help you to determine which kind of plugin you'll be creating:

If the right plugin type is still not obvious, please <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo#can-you-help-me">ask us</a>. Sometimes multiple plugin types could work (depending on the datasource), and we can help you figure out which one would work best.

## 3. Fork the Plugin Repository

Now that you know which plugin type you'll be using for your instant answer, you'll have to fork the associated DuckDuckHack Plugin repository ([GitHub instructions](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)) so you can start coding:

* Click [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/fork) to fork the **Goodie** Plugin Repository (https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies)
* Click [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/fork) to fork the **Spice** Plugin Repository (https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice)
* Click [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/fork) to fork the **Fathead** Plugin Repository (https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead)
* Click [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-longtail/fork) to fork the **Longtail** Plugin Repository (https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-longtail)

## 4. Start Coding!

<!-- ***Important:*** The documentation contained herein is additive. In order to make a Spice plugin, for example, you must first understand how to make a Goodie plugin. This is because the back-end of a Spice plugin is essentially just a goodie that injects an HTTP call into the client JS instead of returning an answer.  -->

At this point, you're ready to start learning about the plugin type you'll be using for your instant answer:

* For **Goodies**, check out the [Goodies Overview](goodies_overview.md). This will give you a list of links to other pages that will guide you through the goodie process.

* For **Spice**, proceed to the [Spice Overview](spice_overview.md). This section will walk you through everything you need to build a basic spice plugin.

* For **Fathead**, check out the Readme in the [fathead repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead).
* For **Longtail**, check out the Readme in the [longtail repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-longtail).
